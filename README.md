## 👋 About Me  

Hi there, I'm Thomas, a full-stack developer. I have 5 years of experience in building websites and SAAS products for local and international clients. I’m looking forward to bringing my skills to your team.

The latest product I've worked on as a lead full-stack developer is DogBoardingPH, an app that connects pet owners with dog sitters to find reliable care for their pets while they're away.

I’ve also worked as a lead full-stack developer on a contact management app for organizing connections and a task management app to help plan and do tasks efficiently.
